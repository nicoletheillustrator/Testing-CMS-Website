# Testing some headless CMS, using netlify and React. 
My goals for this repository is to get an understanding of how to use a headless CMS along with JSON files to make a static blog site, editable from someone elses computer. For example, adding, deleting and editing blogs. But preferrablly without having to use markdown files, as React sort of has it's own "markdown" system.
